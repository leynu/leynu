- 🌱 The 2022 goals are:
  - To start making my repositories **Public**
  - To get better at my R coding skills using [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) 
  - Learn more about **Multiple Imputation using R**
  - Learn to type without looking 🙈 [A website to learn and practice touch typing!](https://www.keybr.com/) 
  - To survive the 66 days "learn [French](https://www.duolingo.com/course/fr/en/Learn-French) challenge" with my children
