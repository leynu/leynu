### Hi there 👋

This is the place where I will (hopefully :rofl:) opensource stuff 

- 🔭 I’m currently working at [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/)
- 🌱 The 2022 goals are:
  - To start making my repositories **Public**
  - To get better at my R coding skill using [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) 
  - Learn more about **Multiple Imputation using R**
  - Learn to type without looking 🙈 [A website to learn and practice touch typing!](https://www.keybr.com/) 
  - To survive the 66 days "learn [French](https://www.duolingo.com/course/fr/en/Learn-French) challenge" with my children 
- 📫 How to reach me: [@leynu_](https://twitter.com/leynu_) or [@leynu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leynu/)
- ⚡ &nbsp;Fun fact: I :heart: :cat:s
