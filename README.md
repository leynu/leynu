### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the place where I will (hopefully :rofl:) opensource stuff 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at IQVIA [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/)
- ðŸŒ± The 2022 goals are:
  - To get better at my R coding skill using [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) 
  - Learn more about **Multiple Imputation using R**
  - Learn to type without looking ðŸ™ˆ [A website to learn and practice touch typing!](https://www.keybr.com/) 
  - To survive the 66 days "learn French challenge" with my children
